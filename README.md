# Fruit Identification and Classification Model

## Overview

This repository contains a machine learning model for the identification and classification of fruits—specifically apples, bananas, and oranges—based on their ripeness levels: raw, ripe, and rotten. The project aims to leverage image recognition techniques to automate the classification process.

## Introduction

The goal of this project is to develop a robust AI model that can accurately classify fruits by their type and ripeness. This can be useful in various applications, such as automated quality checks in grocery stores and agriculture.

## Dataset

The dataset consists of images of fruits labeled by type (apple, banana, orange) and ripeness (raw, ripe, rotten). You can find sample images in the `data/images` directory.

For training the model, consider using publicly available datasets, or you can collect your own images. Ensure the dataset is well-balanced across all categories for optimal performance.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- TensorFlow/Keras or PyTorch
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- [Any other libraries or tools you used]

## Model Architecture

The model is built using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture. The main components include:

- **Convolutional Layers**: To extract features from images.
- **Pooling Layers**: To reduce dimensionality.
- **Fully Connected Layers**: For classification based on extracted features.
- **Activation Functions**: ReLU and Softmax for non-linearity and output probabilities.

You can find the model architecture in `src/model.py`.

## Training the Model

To train the model, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git@github.com:Dipesh30/Fruit-Classification-Project.git
Navigate to the project directory:
bash
Copy code
cd fruit-classification
Install the required packages:
bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Prepare your dataset and place the images in the data/images directory.
Run the training script:
bash
Copy code
python train.py
Usage
Once the model is trained, you can use it to classify new fruit images. To test the model, run the following command:

bash
Copy code
python classify.py --image path/to/your/image.jpg
The output will display the predicted fruit type and ripeness level.
